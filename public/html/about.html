            </h2>
            <p>
                Our team is focused on encouraging teens to learn programming. We believe that programming is a crucial skill that every teen should learn.
            </p>
            <p>
                We prepare workshops to teach people how to code. We also have a robotics workshop where we teach how to build robots.
                Sometimes there can be some fun prizes for the very special people that participate in our competitions.
